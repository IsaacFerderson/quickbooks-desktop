Although QuickBooks is best known for its bookkeeping software, it offers a range of accounting and finance solutions for small businesses. Here are some examples:

QuickBooks Payroll: Available as a self-service or full-service solution, it allows businesses to pay up to 50 employees via cheque or direct deposit. If you opt for a full-service package, your year-end W-2 tax forms for local, state and federal taxes are automatically calculated and filed.
QuickBooks Commerce: It brings all of your orders and inventory onto a central dashboard, giving you the real-time status of every order. QuickBooks Commerce is highly scalable and you can use it to quickly add new sales channels or build your B2B commerce platform and integrate with online marketplaces.
QuickBooks Online: You can keep your accounting books in the cloud, accessible from anywhere at any time, using QuickBooks Online. This service also has invoicing capabilities.
QuickBooks Live: Using QuickBooks Live you can partner with an expert bookkeeper to help with all your bookkeeping needs.
QuickBooks Payments: QuickBooks payments allow you to generate pay-enabled invoices, set up recurring invoices and get paid on the go digitally. Your customers can pay digitally using the method they want.
QuickBooks Time: Track billable hours for your employees or clients or projects using QuickBooks Time. The time you track is easy with QuickBooks Payroll as well as payments.
All these apps integrate seamlessly with each other and QuickBooks accounting software, thus building a well-rounded accounting and payments ecosystem for your small and mid-sized business.

How QuickBooks Works
While there are many options available, you do not need to sign up for all of the QuickBooks services all at once. You can start with a single app, such as the accounting or payroll software, and add others as you expand. If you outgrow any service, you can choose to remove or upgrade it as needed.

A typical QuickBooks setup might look like this: you start by signing up for the accounting software and then adding QuickBooks Live to help fully customize your setup. As your business grows, you hire full-time employees, contractors and freelancers. You can then sign up for QuickBooks Payroll to streamline monthly payments and QuickBooks Time to keep track of billable hours.

QuickBooks Software Options
Invoicing is one of the most crucial functions for many businesses, especially those that provide services or rely on freelancers. QuickBooks makes it easy to create invoices either from scratch or from an earlier estimate. You can even set up an invoice for recurring payments.

You can then share the invoice with clients through the mail or take a printout and send a hard copy. It allows you to run and view reports easily like the number of outstanding invoices, total amount due from clients and details of each invoice (paid or due).

QuickBooks Online is software that helps you run your accounting and bookkeeping from any computer because it stores all your accounting online. QuickBooks Desktop is a version you purchase and use for just one computer.
